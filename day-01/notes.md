\# Day 1 - Python Basics



\*\*Date:\*\* October 24, 2024  

\*\*Duration:\*\* 2.5 hours  

\*\*Course:\*\* Jose Portilla - Complete Python Bootcamp



\## 📚 Topics Learned



\### 1. The print() Function

\- Displays output to the screen

\- Can print strings, numbers, and variables

\- Can combine multiple items with commas or +



\*\*Examples:\*\*

```python

print("Hello World")

print("Hello", name)

print("Hello " + name)

```



\### 2. The input() Function

\- Gets user input from keyboard

\- \*\*Always returns a STRING\*\* (important!)

\- Need to convert to int() for numbers



\*\*Examples:\*\*

```python

name = input("What's your name? ")

age = int(input("Enter age: "))

```



\### 3. Variables

\- Store data in named containers

\- Can be reassigned

\- Use descriptive names



\*\*Examples:\*\*

```python

name = "Venkatesh"

age = 35

city = "Royersford"

```



\## 💻 Programs Created



1\. \*\*Simple Greeting\*\* - Asked for name and greeted user

2\. \*\*Age Calculator\*\* - Calculated age from birth year

3\. \*\*Favorite Things\*\* - Collected and displayed preferences

4\. \*\*Basic Calculator\*\* - Added two numbers



\## 🔑 Key Learnings



\### Important Concepts:

\- `input()` always returns a string

\- Use `int()` to convert string to number

\- Use `str()` to convert number to string

\- String concatenation with `+`



\### Common Patterns:

```python

\# Getting number input

age = int(input("Enter age: "))



\# Converting back to string for printing

print("You are " + str(age) + " years old")

```



\## 🐛 Challenges Faced



1\. \*\*TypeError when adding numbers\*\*

&nbsp;  - Problem: Tried to add string + number

&nbsp;  - Solution: Convert input to int() first



2\. \*\*String concatenation\*\*

&nbsp;  - Problem: Can't use + with string and number

&nbsp;  - Solution: Convert number to str() first



\## ✅ Accomplishments



\- ✅ Python and PyCharm installed

\- ✅ First programs written and working

\- ✅ Understanding of basic I/O

\- ✅ GitHub repository created

\- ✅ Learning journal started



\## 🎯 Tomorrow's Goals (Day 2)



\- Learn about data types (int, float, string, bool)

\- Understand mathematical operators

\- Learn string formatting

\- Practice more with type conversions

\- Build 3-4 new programs
